            <p>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season 
            chicken with salt and pepper and add to the hot pot to brown, 6 to 7 minutes per 
            side. Transfer chicken to a bowl and cover with an aluminum foil tent.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce heat to medium; add onion to the pot and sauté until translucent, 
            about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in sofrito and cook 
            for 2 to 3 minutes. Add potatoes, chicken broth, tomato sauce, sazón, 
            cumin, and bay leaf; bring to a boil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Return chicken to the pot. Cover and cook for 1 hour. Remove chicken.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into simmering 
            mixture until nicely thickened. Place chicken back into the pot and 
            cook together for about 10 minutes more.</p>
