    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
            Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to 
                the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. 
                Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. 
                Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook 
                until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy 
                cast-iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over 
                high heat. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until 
                tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add grilled tomatoes, 
                vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, 
                cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. 
                Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned 
                meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely 
                covered with sauce; cover with a lid.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, 
                until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the 
                lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 
                20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, 
                and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. 
                Shred meat with two forks, then return meat to the pot and stir 
                with the sauce to combine.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top 
                with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. 
                Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides 
                are crispy and cheese is melted.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</p>
        </li>          
    </ol>
